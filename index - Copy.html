<h2>Caseys Custom History</h2>
	<p> Caseys Custom was started out of my home garage during the summer of 2020 due to Covid. I always enjoyed woodworking and enjoyed my high school woodworking classes. I wanted to get back into it and what better time to start when all we could do was stay home during this time. 

<h3>Sparked Imagination</h3>
	<p> I started out by looking up different easy crafts that I could build that weren't challenging. My very first build was a Tailgate Bench. I really enjoy making these benches and have found easier, better, and more affordable ways of building them since I've started. After getting the hang of all of my tools and creating different projects is when I had my first personal custom order of a Dinning Storage Table. This is when I realized that I could really make anything I put my mind to even if it was challenging. 

<h3>Customer Reviews</h3>
	<p> Many people have reached out to Caseys Custom for personal customized projects. Whether it be from my websites and social media or from seeing us at Craft Shows. Here are some reviews that have been done about Caseys Custom. "Good work by a very nice young man. We love our bench in the entryway!", "Casey did a beautiful job on my custom wine rack! He was able to vreate a custom order with my exact specifications in only a few days. Casey was extremely responsive and very friendly throughout the process. If you're looking for a beautiful custom piece at an affordable price, I highly recomment this shop!"
